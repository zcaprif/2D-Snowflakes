# 2D-Snowflakes

A code I developed in python that generates a 2D snowflake on a hexagonal grid using cellular automata, based on C. Reiter's work.

The .ipynb file shows the case to generate one snowflake for some arbitrary chosen values just to show the kind of result you would get if you ran it. The model can be extended to work in 3D and if I have time one day I shall attempt to do so.
